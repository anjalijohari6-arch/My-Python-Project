# My-Python-Project
This notebook performs end-to-end data cleaning, transformation, and feature engineering across three datasets: Employee, Projects, and Assignments., cleaning column formats,  updating employee attributes,  generating computed fields,  preparing the final cleaned CSV files for analysis

## 📘 Capstone Project — Employee & Project Data Cleaning (Python)

This project focuses on cleaning, transforming, and consolidating three related datasets—Employees, Projects, and Assignments—using Python.
It demonstrates practical skills in data preprocessing, handling missing values, feature engineering, looping logic, and preparing datasets for downstream analytics.

The full code is available in the notebook:
Capstone (2).ipynb (uploaded in this workspace).

# 🔍 Project Objectives

1️⃣ Consolidate Multiple Tables

- **Import 3 datasets: Employee, Project, and Assignment tables**

- **Merge them to create a single, unified master dataframe**

2️⃣ Handle Missing Values (Running Average Imputation)**

- **Identify missing values in the project cost column**

- **Apply a running average algorithm using a Python for loop**

- **Update null cost values with dynamically computed averages**

3️⃣ Name Column Transformation

- **Split the name column into**

   - **FirstName**

   - **LastName**

- **Remove the original combined name column**

4️⃣ Additional Data Processing Tasks

From Task 4 to Task 10, the notebook includes additional steps such as:

- **Standardizing column formats**

- **Updating employee-related fields**

- **Imputing missing or inconsistent values**

- **Generating calculated fields (bonuses, classification, etc.)**

- **Preparing final cleaned CSV outputs**
